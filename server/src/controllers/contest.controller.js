 * later retracts (VAR); the historical feed is only published once the match is
 * over, so it is already the corrected version.
 *
 * Goals are counted from `Action: "goal"` events, NOT from the Stats counters.
 * The counters proved unreliable here (they settled a 2-3 win as a draw); the
 * event stream is what the frontend timeline uses and it matches reality.
 *
 * The feed RE-EMITS each goal as it learns more about it, so identical goals are
 * deduped by (clock, participant) — counting raw emissions would treble the score.
 *
 * A penalty that is scored does NOT produce a "goal" action. It arrives as
 * `penalty_outcome` with `Data.Outcome: "Scored"` and nothing else, so counting
 * only `Action: "goal"` would have settled France 0-1 Spain as a DRAW.
