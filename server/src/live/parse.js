 * Turns raw TxLINE score updates into match events the room can render.
 *
 * Everything here is a consequence of how the feed actually behaves:
 *
 *   - `Action` names the event ("goal", "yellow_card", "substitution"), and the
 *     player is referenced by Data.PlayerId — which is the player's *normativeId*
 *     in the Lineups, not their fixturePlayerId.
 *
 *   - The feed RE-EMITS an event as it learns more about it. A goal first arrives
 *     with Data:{}, and the PlayerId only turns up in a later copy at the same
 *     clock. So events are keyed by (action, clock, side) and enriched as the
 *     amendments land — never taken at first sight.
 *
 *   - Minutes round UP: 1761s is the 30th minute, not the 29th.
